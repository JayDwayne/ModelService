label: Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer
description: The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) comprises
  dynamic crop growth simulation model for over 40 crops. The model simulates growth
  development; and yield as a function of the soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics.

- name: rainfall
  description: The degree to perturb rainfall from the baseline model. This should
    be a real number,  which, if 0, would indicate no rainfall in any district. If
    1 it would indicate rainfall matching baseline estimates. 1.25 would indicate
    a 25% increase in rainfall from off the baseline estimate.

- name: fertilizer
  description: This a scalar between 0 and 200 which represents fertilizer in kg/ha.
    100 is considered the  baseline amount (per management practice), so anything
    above 100 represents additional  fertilizer usage/availability and anything below
    100 represents decreased fertilzer (per  management practice).

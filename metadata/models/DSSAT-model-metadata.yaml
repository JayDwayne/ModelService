description: |
  The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) comprises dynamic crop growth simulation model for over 40 crops. The model simulates growth development; and yield as a function of the soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics.

    description: Amount of area harvested under all management practices for this point (ha)
  - name: Yield
    description: Yield for the given point/management practice (kg)
  - name: management_practice
    description: >
      Indicates the type of management practice for the given yield/point combination. 
      1 corresponds to high nitrogen, 2 to irrigated high nitrogen, 3 to 
      subsistence, and 4 to low nitrogen.

parameters:
- name: samples
    description: >
      The number of pixel predictions DSSAT will make. Setting samples to 0 returns the 
      entire geography (all Ethiopia) which is quite large.
    metadata:
      type: NumberParameter
      default: 0
      minumum: 1
      maximum: 0
- name: management_practice
    description: >
      The management practice to model. "maize_rf_highN" corresponds to a high nitrogen management 
      practice. "maize_irrig" corresponds to a high nitrogen, irrigated management practice. "maize_rf_0N" 
      corresponds to a subsistence management practice. "maize_rf_lowN" corresponds to a low nitrogen 
      managemet practice. If set to "combined", all practices are produced.

        - combined

        - maize_rf_lowN
  - name: start_year
    description: >
      The year to begin the simulation. The earliest possible year to begin is 1984 and the latest is 
      2019.
    metadata:
      type: TimeParameter
      default: 1984
      minumum: 1984
      maximum: 2018
  - name: number_years
    description: >
      The number of years to run the simulation. If start_year + number_years - 1 > 2018 then this 
      will be set such that your simulation runs through 2018.
    metadata:
      type: TimeParameter
      default: 35
      minumum: 1
      maximum: 35         
  - name: rainfall
    description: >
      The degree to perturb rainfall from the baseline model. This should be a real number, 
      which, if 0, would indicate no rainfall in any district. If 1 it would indicate rainfall
      matching baseline estimates. 1.25 would indicate a 25% increase in rainfall from off the
      baseline estimate.
    metadata:
      type: NumberParameter
      default: 1
      minumum: 0
      maximum: 2
  - name: fertilizer
    description: >
      This a scalar between 0 and 200 which represents fertilizer in kg/ha. 100 is considered the 
      baseline amount (per management practice), so anything above 100 represents additional 
      fertilizer usage/availability and anything below 100 represents decreased fertilzer (per 
      management practice).
    metadata:
      type: NumberParameter
      default: 100
      minumum: 0
      maximum: 200  
  - name: planting_start
    description: >
      This is the month and day in "mm-dd" format when planting should begin. This allows the modeler 
      to simulate various planting seasons (such as Belg and Maher).
    metadata:
      type: TimeParameter
      default: "03-01"
      minumum: "01-01"
      maximum: "12-31"
  - name: planting_end
    description: >
      This is the month and day in "mm-dd" format when planting should end. This allows the modeler 
      to simulate various planting seasons (such as Belg and Maher). This must be after the 
      planting_start parameter.
    metadata:
      type: TimeParameter
      default: "05-20"
      minumum: "01-01"

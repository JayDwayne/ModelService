description: Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS)
  is a 35+ year quasi-global rainfall data set. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes)
  and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology,
  CHPclim, 0.05° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create
  gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

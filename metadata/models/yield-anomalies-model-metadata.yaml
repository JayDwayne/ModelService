label: Global and national yield anomalies for wheat, maize and millet based on LPJmL
description: >
  We use LPJmL, a well-established dynamic global vegetation, hydrology and crop-growth model,
  to simulate wheat, maize and millet yield anomalies for 2018 based on climate, soil conditions and
  management regimes. Observed weather data are fed into the model until April 30, 2018;
  afterwards, to simulate the uncertainty of operational forecasts, weather data is sourced from the
  portion May 01-Dec 31 from the previous years (1984-2017). The crop model runs on a global grid
  with 0.5Â° size in latitude and longitude.

  We provide yield anomalies as deviation from the mean of 2013-2017 as simulated by LPJmL. The
  data is available on a global grid and as nationally aggregated anomalies. Apart from a default
  simulation, assuming the same management in 2018 as for the previous years, we provide
  alternative intervention scenarios that assume different irrigation levels, more nitrogen input, or
  both. In total, there are 3 (crops) * 12 (scenarios) = 36 hypothetical back-casting simulations. Each
  of these scenarios is calculated for each of the 34 different 2018 climate realizations.

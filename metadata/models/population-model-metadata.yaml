description: 'The population model is grounded on a method called Component Analysis
  (or Component Method) 1, which takes into account Crude Birth Rates (CBR), Crude
  Death Rates (CDR), and migration rates (inmigration and outmigration). Any of these
  rates may change in a linear or non-linear fashion.

  popt = popt-1 + popt-1 * CBRt*(1 + birth_rate_fct) - popt-1 * CDRt *(1 + death_rate_fct)
  + Immigrationt- Outmigrationt

  In this equaiton, death/birth_rate fct is applied to the nominal growth rates. It
  is used for sensitivity studies of changes in the growth rate. For example, if one
  uses a birth_rate_fct of 0.1 this will boost the nominal growth rates by 10%. These
  variables are put in place to account for any possible bias in the census data.'

id: malnutrition_model
label: Malnutrition Model
description: Currently, the malnutrition model takes the following input variables
  CHIRPS, Consumer Price Index(CPI), population, cereal production per capita, consumption
  expenditure,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),and month to predict the
  malnutrition rates for Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition
  (SAM). According to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, GAM and SAM are defined
  as weight-for-height z-score below -2, and weight-for-height z-score below -3, respectively.
  By this definition, GAM includes all categories of malnutrition.

label: Malnutrition Model
description: >
  Currently, the malnutrition model takes the following input variables CHIRPS, Consumer Price Index(CPI), population, cereal production per capita, consumption expenditure,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),and month to predict the malnutrition rates for Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). According to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, GAM and SAM are defined as weight-for-height z-score below -2, and weight-for-height z-score below -3, respectively. By this definition, GAM includes all categories of malnutrition.

    description: >
      The percentage of rainfall can be specified for this model by providing a float based on the 
      following scale: 0 is no rainfall, 100 is the same as the recorded amount, 200 is 2 times the 
      recorded amount.

label: APSIMx-G-Range
description: "G-Range is a global rangeland model that simulates generalised changes in rangelands through time. Spatial data and a set of parameters that describe plant growth in landscape units combine with computer code representing ecological processes to represent soil nutrient and water dynamics, vegetation growth, fire, and wild and domestic animal offtake. The model is spatial, with areas of the world divided into square cells. Those cells that are rangelands have ecosystem dynamics simulated. A graphical user interface allows users to explore model output."

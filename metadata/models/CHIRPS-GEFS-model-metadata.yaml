label: Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data Global Ensemble Forecast System
description: |
  NCEPâ€™s Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast system that provides daily forecasts out to 16 days at 1 X 1 degree resolution at 6-hour intervals. This forecast product can be very useful to early warning famine and hydrological monitoring efforts, so the Climate Hazards Group (CHG) creates forecast precipitation fields at the dekadal (10 day) time scale and makes those available to researchers and decision makers.

      This should be one of ['mm_data','mm_anomaly','none_z-score']. mm_data is the CHIRPS estimates 
      of precipitation. The mm_anomaly provides the data value minus the mean of the entire time 
      series up to the previous year. none_z-score provides the Standardized Precipitation Indexes (SPI) 
      of the estimates.

      The geospatial bounding box of interest. It should represent 4-elements in the WGS84 
      coordinate system: [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]. x is longitude, y is latitude. In other 
      words, the coordinates of a SW point and a NE point define your region of interest.

# Yield Anomalies Model (LPJmL)

Running `maas_install.sh` directly invokes `yield_anomalies_data.py`. This file establishes model runs for the 180 available yield anomalies model runs provided by PIK. This script assumes that these runs are already stored in S3 at `world-modelers/results/yield_anomalies_model`.
